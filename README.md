The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application designed to allow multiple users to simultaneously edit documents in real time, similar to tools like Google Docs. It leverages modern full-stack technologies to provide a responsive, fast, and synchronized editing experience.
The frontend is built using React.js, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface. It utilizes the Quill rich text editor for document formatting and editing. The real-time collaboration functionality is powered by Socket.IO, which establishes a persistent WebSocket connection between clients and the server to broadcast changes instantly as users type.
The backend is developed using Node.js with Express, acting as an API server and WebSocket manager. It handles document creation, real-time broadcasting of changes, and periodic autosaving. For data storage, MongoDB is used to persist document contents efficiently, ensuring that user changes are reliably stored and retrievable.
Key features include:
Real-time syncing across users editing the same document
Autosave functionality every few seconds
Unique document ID generation via URL routing
Quill editor for formatting text
This project demonstrates the use of full-stack JavaScript technologies for building real-time applications. It integrates frontend reactivity, backend scalability, and real-time communication using sockets, making it a solid foundation for more complex collaborative platforms.
